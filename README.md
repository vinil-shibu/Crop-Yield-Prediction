# Crop-Yield-Prediction

Crop yield is a standard measurement of the amount of agricultural production harvested—yield of a crop—per unit of land area. 
Crop yield is the measure most often used for cereal, grain, or legumes; and typically is measured in bushels,tons, or pounds per acre
To estimate crop yield, producers usually count the amount of a given crop harvested in a sample area. Then the harvested crop is weighed, and the crop yield of the
entire field is extrapolated from the sample. Crop yield can also refer to the actual seed generation from the plant. For example, a grain of wheat yielding
three new grains of wheat would have a crop yield of 1:3. Sometimes crop yield is referred to as "agricultural output."

Machine learning (ML) could be a crucial perspective for acquiring real-world and operative solution for crop yield issue. Considering the present system
including manual counting, climate smart pest management and satellite imagery, the result obtained aren’t really accurate. This paper focuses mainly on predicting
the yield of the crop by applying various machine learning techniques.

By conducting research on the datasets, Random Forest machine learning algorithm gives the best yield prediction accuracy.

Random Forest has the ability to analyze crop growth related to the current climatic conditions and biophysical change. Random forest
algorithm creates decision trees on different data samples and then predict the data from each subset and then by voting gives better solution for the
system. Random Forest uses the bagging method to train the data which increases the accuracy of the result.
